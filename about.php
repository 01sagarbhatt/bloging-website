    Welcome to <strong>The Himalayan Post</strong> â€” a simple blogging website developed as a college project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. This project is designed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provide a platform where users can post, edit, and view blogs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The purpose of this project is to understand and implement core web development concepts including database connectivity, PHP scripting, and frontend design. All blog posts are stored in a MySQL database, and the admin panel allows for easy management of content.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    This platform also helps in understanding user interaction with web forms, validation techniques, and dynamic data handling. The UI is kept minimal yet functional to maintain focus on the development logic behind it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Through this project, students can learn how modern blogs function at the backend and how they can be customized or scaled. It serves as a great foundation for larger content-based projects or even personal blogging portfolios.
